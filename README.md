# LAHVII
Los Altos Hacks 2023 Spring Submission!

## Inspiration: 
Our inspiration for this project is completely from the massive amount of people that spend their lives stuck on social media with no benefits to their brain. We want to leverage this group of individuals and provide an application that can keep individuals challenged to stay on top of their work, in addition to acting as a way for them to interact while staying productive.

## What it does: 
Our product is an AI-powered application that utilizes the user-base of social media to propel people into a better and more productive platform, one that is capable of assigning challenges to the user and helping them stay productive without drifting away with a distracting interface or notifications. A platform that allows them to learn and to be more productive but continue to interact with their peers! Our application can also branch out into many applicable uses utilizing AI-power including creating schedules and shopping lists. The possibilities dont only end here, in fact, they are literally endless.

## How we built it: 
We built our application with the aid of software development and android emulators such as Flutter and Android Studios so our application can be installed on mobile devices.

## Challenges we ran into:
 The the greatest challenge our team faced is the installation and the configurations for Flutter and Android Studios. We spent a great deal of time trying to make them to work because without these software development, our project would not be feasible.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We are proud of creating a working application that can relieve and to help individuals buried in social media without benefits become more productive. Above all though, finishing this in such a short amount of time is what we're most proud of!

## What we learned: 
We learned how to split up a challenge into feasible components where each teammate can work on small fragments of the project. After each fragment is finished, we can merge our efforts together to generate our final project.

## What's next for: 
We want to introduce this application to a larger audience in increase our userbase.
